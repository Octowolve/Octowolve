### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## I'm Octowolve. Also know as Silence or HelloWhyMe (from GuidedHacking.com)
I'm a game hacker and programmer for android. I love to share my work and help others to learn the same.
I have a small forum where I will post more and more tutorials about android game hacking.

I'm currently working on making game hacking for android as easy as possible via detailed tutorials. Alot of stuff for android is "secret" and "shouldn't be shared".
But I think knowledge should be free and easily accessible everywhere by everyone,
That's why I started this small forum, to help and teach others android game hacking.

You can reach out to my via my forum or my discord server.
